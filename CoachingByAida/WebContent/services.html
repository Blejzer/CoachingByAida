					<h2>Get to know yourself to be your best Self</h2>
					<div class="border"></div>
					<p>The interaction between the different personalities of
						individuals can be a frequent source of friction. However, this
						can largely be avoided by understanding and valuing yourself and
						people's differences.</p>
					<h3>
						<strong>Three Self-ish areas in which you can grow,
							personally and as a leader: <br>Self-awareness, Self-esteem,
							Self-efficacy.
						</strong>
					</h3>

						<p>
							<strong>Self-awareness</strong> is the ability to be on top of
							the feelings, impulses, and thoughts that run through yourself at
							any given time. Self-awareness is the fundamental emotional
							competence. It is our guide in fine tuning 'on the job'
							performance, keeping ourselves motivated, developing good work
							related social skills, including those essential for leadership
							and team work. In order to develop your self-awareness, you
							should learn more about personality, emotional intelligence,
							empathy, communication, thinking and learning styles.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Self-esteem</strong> is a term used in psychology to
							reflect a person's overall emotional evaluation of his or her own
							worth. Building Self-esteem and assertiveness is probably a lot
							easier than you think. Find out what your strengths and style are
							and use them to support your position never basing your
							self-esteem on anything external.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Self-efficacy</strong> is the measure of one's own
							ability to complete tasks and reach goals.
						</p>
						<p>"..But he who knows, and knows that he knows, is a wise man
							- follow him." (Confucius)</p>
						<p>In order to develop your self-efficacy, you should know
							more about motivation, goals, stress and time management. But
							above all to develop self-efficacy you need to integrate the
							principle of self-responsibility. The responsibility for how you
							respond to life around you, and therefore what comes back to you,
							lies in the choice of your perception. Your perception is based
							on your beliefs. If you believe you can't, then guess what, you
							won't! This fatal belief limits your capacity expansion.</p>

					<h2>Individual Assessment Tools</h2>
					<div class="border"></div>
					<p>What would you like to know about yourself? What would you
						like to know about your Personality? What role do you often plan
						in a team? What is your most domineering management style and
						when?</p>
					<div class="p-stiliziran">
						<p>To determine the preferences of your personality type, and
							to discover what function within yourself you should and could
							develop, just as a rough indicator, fill in the Cognitive style
							Inventory which will give you approximate answer to the question
							of what your four-letter code is according to the MBTI (Myers
							Briggs Type Indicator*).</p>
						<p>
							(After determining your 4 Type letters, you can jump to a number
							of web sites such as <a
								href="http://www.personalitypathways.com/" target="_blank"
								class="different">MBTI &amp; Myers Briggs, Profiles and
								Characteristics of the 16 Myers Briggs Personality Types</a> to help
							you get acquainted with the characteristics and indicators of the
							16 types and verify if your type, as determined by this
							"unscientific" survey, seems to "fit" or not.)
						</p>
						<p>* The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a powerful aid
							to both team and personal development by providing a method for
							understanding and assessing personality, and valuing people's
							differences.</p>

							<br>So, for example: ENFP
							(Extravert-Intuition-Feeling-Perceiving) personality type focus
							on outside world, and his/her method for handling the outside
							world is by gathering data and keeping options open. ENFP prefers
							to form a view and receive information on what he/she imagine
							things can mean, and is friendly and sensitive to others. Within
							the ENFP personality type, dominant function is N (Intuition),
							and F (Feeling) is the auxiliary function. Weakest functions of
							this ENFP personality type would be: Sensing and Judging, which
							needs to be developed. Actually, ENFP type needs to work on
							observing facts and specifics, and to speed up evaluation and
							deciding process.

							<a href="#">Personal Coaching to Change Your Life</a>
						</h3>
						<p>If you look at the different aspects of your life - about
							what's really important to you, what do you see? Are there
							difficult decisions and changes you need to make in your family
							life, relationships, career..? Do you need to increase your
							confidence or motivation to do things? Do you desire a more
							peaceful, stress-free and positive life? Or you are working with
							a manager/organization who has authoritarian management style and
							you need to know ways of managing this manager/organization? Do
							you need to know ways to help you resist bullying?</p>
						<p>Below are some of the most common areas in which I support
							my clients as a personal coach:</p>
						<h3>
							<a href="#">Relationship Coaching:</a>
						</h3>
						<p>Our social interactions can be a source of tremendous
							pleasure or pain:</p>
						<p>Are you fulfilled with your social life?</p>
						<p>Are you surrounded by people that care about you and that
							keep you enthusiastic to do the things that are important to you
							- or are you lonely or worse yet, surrounded by people that drain
							you?</p>
						<p>If you're with a partner, is your relationship a healthy
							one?</p>
						<p>What could you do to make your relationship even stronger?</p>
						<h3>
							<a href="#">Family Coaching:</a>
						</h3>
						<p>Your immediate and extended family can have a significant
							influence on your life, your decisions and your overall
							happiness:</p>
						<p>Are you satisfied with your family relationships?</p>
						<p>How content are you with your spouse, siblings, children or
							even your extended family?</p>
						<p>If this area of life is important to you, are you happy
							with it?</p>
						<p>Is there a conflict with a family member you'd like to
							resolve?</p>
						<h3>Career Coaching:</h3>
						<p>Most people spend roughly a third of their lives at work:
							that fact alone should stress the importance of being happy with
							what you do. Below are some questions to reflect on:</p>
						<p>How satisfied are you with your current role and career
							progression?</p>
						<p>Do you enjoy your work environment and your colleagues?</p>
						<p>Is your full potential being realised with your current
							job?</p>
						<p>Are you happy with your current work-life balance?</p>
						<h3>Personal coaching as part of an integrated approach to
							organizational development:</h3>
						<p>Personal coaching skills, methodologies and principles
							offer a radically new perspective to organizations looking for
							effective and innovative training and development solutions for
							their people, managers and executives.</p>
						<p>The nature of personal coaching as a learning and
							development model enables a different and effective approach to
							developing traditional 'intangibles' - for example positive
							behaviour, integrity, humanity, ethics, mentoring, culture,
							emotional maturity, etc - which are so vital for successful
							performance of modern organizations.</p>

					<h2>Executive Coaching</h2>
					<div class="border"></div>
					<p>People, relationships, organizations, leadership, and

						<p>The focus on executive coaching is on development and
							action that helps you go way beyond your perceived potential.</p>
						<p>Only recently have individuals and organizations recognized
							that their long-term success is directly linked to the quality of
							their leaders. Good leadership in the modern age more importantly
							requires attitudes and behaviours which characterise and relate
							to humanity. Executive effectiveness is inextricably tied to
							ability to lead and motivate team.</p>
						<p>It's easier to recognize performance gaps in others rather
							than finding those gaps in ourselves. But great leaders recognize
							the importance of continued improvement and support the concept
							of a learning organization.</p>
						<p>Some management skills that you must have are:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>communication,</li>
							<li>teambuilding,</li>
							<li>delegation,</li>
							<li>change management.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>So, you are looking at the ways to improve executives
							individual performance and productivity skills?</p>
						<p>Or want to improve your own time management, communication
							style and leadership style?</p>
						<p>You as executive want assistance to improve the performance
							of executive duties?</p>
