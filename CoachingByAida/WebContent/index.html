						<h3>
							<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-tasks"></i> What is Coaching?</a>
						</h3>
						<p>
							Coaching is about getting the very best out of you and enabling
							you to make decisions that will improve your life.<br>'Coaching'
							can be applied virtually anywhere where people are trained,
							developed and/or helped towards improving performance, and
							achieving success and personal fulfillment.
						</p>

						<p>Coaching is a quite recent area of learning and
							development. Coaching commonly addresses attitudes, behaviors,
							knowledge, as well as skills.</p>

						<p>
							Coaching is a form of change facilitation - it enables people,
							rather than trains them.<br>Coaching is interactive and
							flexible - it allows for personal transition on an individual
							basis.<br>Coaching makes no assumptions - it's not
							judgmental, nor is it prescriptive or instructional.
						</p>
						<h3>
							<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> Coaching principles:</a>
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Everyone is capable of achieving more</li>
							<li>Your past is no indication of your future</li>
							<li>Your beliefs about what is possible for you are your
								only limits</li>
							<li>A coach always provides full support</li>
							<li>Coaches don't provide the answers, they lead you to find
								the answers</li>
							<li>Coaching does not include criticizing you</li>
							<li>All coaching is completely confidential</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Coaching can be conducted wherever coach and client happen
							to be - anywhere in the world. Coaching can be conducted via
							mail, as well. Coaching is just as effective over the
							telephone/cell phone, skype, as it is face-to-face.. This offers
							greater flexibility for people with a busy lifestyle.</p>
						<p>As for the coaching teams, coaching is organized on the
							premises of the company or where company decides to perform
							coaching.</p>
